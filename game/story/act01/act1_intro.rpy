    "--POM MAGE GUILD--"

    "It has been a while since I registered here in order to work legally as a mage in this town."
    "The guild serves as an institute to make sure magic is never abused and help mages find work."
    "The massive guild hall is crowded with mages from around the region."
    "I enter the building as I observe the colorful individuals chatting and showing off their art."

    # CHANGE SCENE

    "Amongst the throng of people, 3 groups stood out to me. I decided to the see what they were up to."
    "The first group stood out in particular because their aura seemed to contrast so much."

    "A brazen young man sporting what looked like kitchen cook clothes responded first."

    KON "Hiya! I am Fire Elementalist Kon! This girl over here is my younger sister, Flo."

    FLO "...Hi.  I am Water Elementalist Flo."
    KON "As you can see, we come from family of elementalists."

    PLAYER "I guess you're a cook judging by your appearance?"

    KON "Hahahahaha. That's right! My fire skills are super convenient for it!"
    KON "I love bringing enjoyment to people thru food I create using this magic that was used to cause mass destruction and fear in the past."

            "The chef gloats at his idealistic purpose as I slowly turn my head away."

    "I ask Flo a question."

    PLAYER "I'm guessing you're still in school?"

    "From her appearance I assumed she was a kid."

    KON "Huh? Flo? HAHAHAHAHA! She's actually 22 and still sticks to me like a little kid ever since she was a toddler!  She's such a big crybaby!"
    FLO "Wh-What are y-you saying?! Don't s-say that!"

    "Flo stammers while flustered at her brother's humiliating comment about her."
    "Big globs of tears start flowing out of her eyes as Kon panics and dries her tears while apologizing."
    "She's definitely a water mage."

    FLO "...*sniff*"
    KON "Phew. Despite her appearance and personality, she's actually a bartender."
    KON "We both work for our family's restaurant."
